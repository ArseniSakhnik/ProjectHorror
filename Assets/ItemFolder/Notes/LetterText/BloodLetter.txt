I understood everything. For the third day I've been eating Uncle Seryozha. This damn village called me, played with my head, as if I had received a call. How the hell did they call, the damn working phone 40 kilometers away from village. I have no chance. This place is cut off from the usual reality. The night has not ended for several weeks, all supplies have run out, switched to corpses. I tried to go out to the river - to walk two hundred meters, but the couldn't make it, wandered for 2 hours and barely get away from the monster. Lost my rifle. All I could find was a charm depicting the sun. I feel that soon I myself become something inhuman.
