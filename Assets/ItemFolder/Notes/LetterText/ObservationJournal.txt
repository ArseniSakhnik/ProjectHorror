I didn't think I'd be here again – but Luda charmed me. I offered her to move to the city, but she didn't. I don't think it will be difficult to get used to village life. The neighbors are Sergey, a fisherman, whose house is a little lower, closer to the river, and Matvey, a plowman.

Even old people and grandmothers don't know what they mean.

I found a wolf figurine. The grandson liked this silly trinket so much. I'll put it in a drawer in my office for now.
