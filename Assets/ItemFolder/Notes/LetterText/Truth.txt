The face of man is the victim
The Face of the wolf is the hunter
The face of the sun is the host
Sleep is the door to the Shepherd's hunting grounds. The faces will protect you from the eyes of the dead, the messenger and the Shepherd. Sleep in the family home of your kind, otherwise the Shepherd will notice you.
