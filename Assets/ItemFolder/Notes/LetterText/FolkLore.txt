One interesting character stands out among the Slavic folklore. According to legend, the wolf Shepherd is the ruler of wolves, as well as the lord of stormy thunderstorms. Myths about the wolf Shepherd  and his retinue are similar to myths about Wild Hunt. The shepherd uses wolves as hounds and mounts, heading to the battlefields. According to one of the legends, the wolf Shepherd  controls wolves who seek to devour the Sun. In order for the wolves to obey, he subdues them with a whip and a club. In its essence, it is neither good nor evil, nor even neutral, but rather maintains balance. The wolf shepherd manages the life of wolves, protecting them from people, or people from them. Assigns tasks and sacrifice to wolves, he often takes part in hunting or fighting. It is believed that the sacrifice appointed by the Shepherd  is inevitably doomed. The Shepherd looks different. He may seem like a gray-haired old man, or a wolf.
It is also known about the outlandish cases of the worship of the Shepherd . According to some legends, young men or maidens were chosen among the communities, who dressed up in wolf skins and became part of the Shepherd's retinue, while the communities in return, as the stories say, lived in wealth. Often these rituals were performed once in a generation, and their nonâ€“observance was associated with failures, diseases and bloodshed, as well as the arrival of an evil wolf - the Shepherd's messenger. To protect against the latter, the ancient Slavs carved special figures and amulets. The most frequently mentioned are the amulets of man, wolf and sun.
