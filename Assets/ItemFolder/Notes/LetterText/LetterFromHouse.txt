The sun has not risen for several days. Yesterday the creature tried to climb into the window – I knocked it down with a shovel. It is not invulnerable, Serega shot her paw with a rifle, and the furry bastard ran away only his heels sparkled. But the animal can definitely recover, while our supplies and ammunition are decreasing and decreasing. Serega has a bunch of rifle cartridges at home – if we break through, we'll collect rifles – we'll chase and shoot the beast. The spare rifle is in the attic, there are also a couple of grandmother's trinkets. I don't know why, but this damn figure is annoying. It's stupid, of course, there's a monster walking in the yard that doesn't belong to this world, and I'm scared of some shitty human figure.
